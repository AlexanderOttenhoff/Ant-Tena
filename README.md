Ant-Tena
=========

Instead of perceiving our surroundings visually as we do on an everyday basis we challenge the player to see though other physiological channels and by this we draw attention to the fact that our common senses should not be taken for granted. This can induce a "therapeutic phenomenon" on the user.
You are an ant, and also blind. You have to navigate the world by sound and touch alone

A Game to experience the perception of an ant

An experimental game that challenges what we perceive to be a videogame

Challenges us to appreciate other senses and experience the world through our other senses

Not so much about winning or accomplishing a task, but about experiencing a surreal world

First unusual and uncomfortable, but with time it becomes relaxing and serene

Encourges us to adapt to new circumstances


In the Game
You are being led by a fellow ant

finding your way and later on food without vision

communicating with other ants and leading them home

distinguish important sounds from noise


Meditative

It can be seen as a matrix for meditative exploration
